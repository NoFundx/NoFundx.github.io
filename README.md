Casket Defense NFTs have several benefits, such as:

- **Scarcity**: There are only 10,000 Casket Defense NFTs in existence, and no more will ever be minted. Each NFT has a unique ID and a set of attributes that make it different from the rest. The rarity of each attribute determines the value of each NFT.
